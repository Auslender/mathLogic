# Predicate Calculus Proof Checker
Predicate contains predicate-calculus proof checker. <br>
Compile Main.java in Predicate/src, and run Main class <br>
~java Main [absolute path to the file with your proof] [absolute path to the file for output]

# HW3
To generate comparison proof of 2 numbers: <br>
compile ProofGenerator.java in HW3/src <br>
run ProofGenerator class, passing a and b (0 <= a, b <= 100) <br>
~java ProofGenerator a b <br>
The resulting proof is in src/compare_proof
